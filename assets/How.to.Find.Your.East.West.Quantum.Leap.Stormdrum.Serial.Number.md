## What's New in Stormdrum 2?
 
Stormdrum 2 is not just a bigger and better version of Stormdrum 1. It also introduces some new features and enhancements that make it a more versatile and expressive percussion library. Here are some of the highlights:

- Stormdrum 2 includes over 12 Gigabytes of all new acoustic percussion instruments, ranging from huge taiko drums and gongs, to ethnic instruments like tablas and udu drums, to metal objects like trashcans and brake drums, to rare and exotic percussion like waterphones and whale drums. The unique selection of drums and percussion included exceeds all other collections.[^1^]
- Stormdrum 2 also includes a bonus Metallica black drum kit from Ministry Of Rock, a hard-hitting rock drum kit that was used by Metallica on their album "St. Anger". This kit is perfect for adding some power and punch to your tracks.[^1^]
- Stormdrum 2 comes with over 100 MIDI performances, each with dozens of variations, intros and endings from bombastic to hypnotic. These performances are designed for film scoring, but can also be used for any genre of music that needs some rhythmic spice. You can use them as they are, or customize them to your liking using the PLAY software engine.[^1^]
- The PLAY software engine allows for millions of variations of each MIDI performance so you can create custom performances at any tempo without any loss of sound quality because the samples are not time-stretched, only the sequencer tempo is changed. You can also change the dynamics, tune, add effects or filters to specific drums, mute specific sounds and play in your own parts, or use the current multi to create your own rhythms.[^1^] [^2^]
- Stormdrum 2 was recorded with vintage Neumann microphones in the famous EastWest Studio 1 (formally United-Western), one of the best sounding percussion recording studios anywhere. It is very similar to the top Hollywood sound-stages, but with a more refined sound. The studio has one of the best mic collections in the world, and rare vintage recording equipment that is sonically superior to any other. Digital transfers were done through very expensive Meitner converters for a pristine sound quality.[^1^] [^2^]

With Stormdrum 2, you get a percussion library that is not only huge and diverse, but also realistic and expressive. Whether you need some epic drums for your film score, some ethnic percussion for your world music project, some metal objects for your industrial track, or some rare and exotic percussion for your ambient soundscape, Stormdrum 2 has it all.
